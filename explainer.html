      <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
    </section>

    <h2>Step 1: Generating content from a JSON file.&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>
      My first step was thinking through what a client would ask about during
      the presentation. Things the client may say --
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Can I change the colors?</li>
      <li>Instead of the circles, can I get different shapes?</li>
      <li>Will this work on my phone?</li>
      <li>How do I (a non-coder) add more contacts?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>#1 to #3 is easy CSS stuff. Not worried!</p>
    <p>
      #4 is where setting this project up properly will make my life easier in
      the long run.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a placeholder json file that contained name/address/info/etc. I
      then made two functions, a getData and a generateTable that ran async
      because they're using fetch and javascript promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>getData</strong> fetches the JSON.
      <strong>generateTable </strong>turns each JSON object into a html
      &lt;tr&gt; piece of content. Within generateTable's function, you can also
      modify how you arrange the content.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Getting something showing</h2>
    <p>
      Once I got the JSON data to display, I set up a quick and dirty version of
      the app. No focus on design, just pure functionality.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a &lt;table&gt;, created a &lt;select&gt; with two options
      (email/phone).
    </p>
    <p>
      This helped me figure out how to best display the colored circle status
      indicator. I went back and modified the hardcoded JSON file to include a
      'status', which included a color - in case future statuses occured (i.e.
      what if they want a Not available except via email?). While it's important
      not to over-engineer, this was a quick and easy future-proofing, so why
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      This also helped me think through how to get that Third image concept to
      work.&nbsp;

    <h2>Step 3: Getting a box showing and changing phone numbers</h2>
    <p>This is where it got fancy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Let's start with the easy thing: Changing phone numbers when you change
      the selector.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The logic to display data in the table exists in
      <strong>generateTable().&nbsp;</strong>Inside was a conditional to say,
      "In column 2... show me the email! Or show me the phone number!" I set up
      a quick global variable boolean called&nbsp;
      --&gt;&nbsp;<strong>isSecondRowShowingEmail&nbsp;</strong>and a event
      listener to check if there's a change.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <em>(Note: I like my variable booleans to be questions. </em
      ><br /><br /><em>isSecondRowShowingEmail = true </em><br /><br /><em
        >makes it easy for me to understand at a glance. My preference is I
        rather have longer variable names if it helps with code readibility.
        Because 99.9% of the time, I don't remember the code i write and I'm the
        one to fix it. :-D )</em
      >
    </p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <p>
      Now the hard thing: How the heck do I go about showing the extra data when
      a row is clicked, at that exact spot?
    </p>
    <p>
      I've done this with menus where you right-click, and a div element pops in
      to recreate the 'windows right click'. But to tie it to that exact corner
      of the table cell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jquery had functionality right out of the box to handle this. And since
      we're JQuery-free, I had to do some research.

        >And it found it here</a
      >! TL;DR:&nbsp;<strong>getBoundingClientRect()&nbsp;</strong>is the
      solution
    </p>
    <p>
      What isn't seen in the code is the handleful of console.logs to play with
      the coordinates and generate the content inside the box.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Actual design</h2>
    <p>Now to up it to 11!</p>
    <p>
      My experience as a web developer has shown that getting the functionality
      to work as a ugly prototype is barely half the battle. Getting the
      functionality to work with the actual design &amp; layout is what
      matters.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      I messed with the CSS and layed out the project. You might see a #app
      element in the HTML because I'm so used to js frameworks now. You will
      also see things built around it.
    </p>
    <p>To match the colors, I opened up the file in a photo editing tool.</p>
    <p>
      For gradients, I googled a generator for that - because gradients in CSS
      is hard.
    </p>
    <p>I tested the design on various screens sizes - and no issues there.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Testing it again with the design</h2>
    <p>
      This is where the little things really started to show. In the third
      screen is a overlay. Column 1's box clearly shows the name, and Column 2's
      box shows the additional data. The table is darkened, but that cell column
      is bright. How does that work?!
    </p>
    <p><img src="third-screen.png" /></p>
    <h3>I'd LOVE to see how others solve this issue.</h3>
    <p>
      My workaround was to create TWO elements on TOP of the file, and turn them
      on/off with opacity, to appear where I click. Then when you clicked out of
      the content, the boxes turn off and hide in the upper-left corner.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Polish and re-factoring&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>
      I reviewed the design to match the colors better. My screen seems weird -
      I wrote purple as a color, but it showed blue. So here's hoping the colors
      work accurately on your screens!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also renamed a few weird classes to better reflect their use-cases.
      Again, I'm banking that i'd be the primary maintainer, so I worked on
      readability.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall - this was one of those fun projects where I knew 90% is solvable,
      and the other 10% was trying a bunch of tests until it works -- and then
      focusing on cleaning things up for production.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>Step 6.1: Last second freak out</h2>
    <p>
      After completing any project, I like to review the details once more in
      case I miss anything. When I read the
      <strong>We wish to assess your CSS skills</strong> part, I freaked out
      because I was unsure if you wanted me to recreate the image complete, or
      have a working app. But the latter sentence about looking at the JS skills
      made me believe that you're looking for a working production-ready app.
    </p>
    <p>
      I typically ask a lot of questions for clarity during a project to avoid
      these minor freak outs.
